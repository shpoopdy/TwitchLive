# Twitch Live!
It's Twitch, but live I think.

# API GET
For this little project I wanted to work on doing an API GET using the Twitch API. I didn't want to have anyone who uses this to authenticate with their account, so this only grabs information given a user name.

## Information grabbed:
1. Username
2. Account creation date

Without going too deep into the API uses right away I just thought it would be pretty neat to be able to see when a Twitch user created their account. I would like to expand on this more in the future.
